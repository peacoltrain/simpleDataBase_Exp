# simpleDataBase_Exp
A brief proof of concept experiementation of implementing a database in supabase.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this database, I modeled a simple reservation application, that allows users to create reservations and admins to manipulate what equipment and other info.

This database was created with supabase. In order to expand my abilities I decided to include stored images as well utilizes some of supabases built in functionality.

This is the visualization of the end schema.
